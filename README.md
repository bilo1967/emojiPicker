# emojiPicker
A simple JQuery picker component for Unicode emoticons

emojiPicker is a very simple JQuery component for selecting unicode emoticons and inserting them into a text field.

The component is ideally associated with a button (or more generally with any clickable tag) and combined with a text field in which the emoji will be inserted.

Here is a minimal example of use:

```javascript
$('#picker-button-id').emojiPicker('any-text-field-id');
```
